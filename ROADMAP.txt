A more detailed roadmap file (compared to what's in README.txt).

Planned additions (backwards compatible):
1) PostgresQL support (allows one to properly store arrays, JSON data, etc.)
2) Feature consistency checking – a feature (or, more generally, a value in a certain column) need not exist for
every single data record (absent key in dict, NULL value in SQL, absent key in MongoDB, absent value in CSV, etc.)
So, a cool thing would be to add methods which do the following
    2.1) Check if feature exists for every record by name – return True/False and a list of records for which it doesn't
    exist (in feature_exists_global)
    2.2) Return a list of all features in the dataset (including an boolean value indicating whether the feature
    exists for every record or not) (in return_feature_names)
    2.3) Partial feature extraction – set start_id, end_id and extract in that range (and add support for merging
    incomplete columns – so people can split extracting a single feature among separate computers)
